Hello :)

This repo contains two files

1. **MathCommands.tex** it contains useful LaTeX shortcuts to use while editing your documents. It contains commands of

   - Delimiters
   - Operators
   - Vectorial Commands
   - Tensorial Commands

2. **EnvironmentsLaTeX.tex** contain useful environments which you can use while editing your document, some of them are

   - Theorems, exercises, examples, corollary, lemma environments
   - Proof and solution environments
   - Images environments

3. If you want to contribute, put the command in the _section_ that suits the most, and if you think that there is not such a section, you can create one
   - If you want to contribute to **MathCommands.tex** put at the end the description of the command and if it needs an special package , like _amsfonts_, etc.
   - If you want to contribute to **EnvironmentsLaTeX.tex** put the description of the environment and if it needs an special package

Some of them are useful to me, and I hope these can help you, :)
